# java-strings.tasks-solution
**In this repository are located solutions to tasks written in the Java programming language to work with String type.**

Names of packages with classes that solve a task have a brief description of the task to be solved.
The description of the tasks to be solved can be read in the comments in the Main class, which is in each package with the tasks to be solved. 
Also in the file README.md.

Many of functional solutions are implemented in the java-helper library classes. 
A detailed description of the functional contained in the library "java-helper" and used for solving tasks can be found 
in the repository by the link: https://github.com/LugowoyKonstantin/java-helper.tasks-solution
